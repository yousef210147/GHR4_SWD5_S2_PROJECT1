# Pathway — Student Tracking & Evaluation Platform

> Bridging the gap between intensive tech bootcamps and real professional opportunities.

---

# 📖 Project Idea

**Pathway** is a centralized digital platform that brings together all training **Initiatives** in one ecosystem. It enables students to discover, enroll in, and manage different learning opportunities through a single account, eliminating the need for scattered systems and manual processes.

The platform empowers students to evaluate their own technical and soft skills through a structured **Self-Assessment** system. Based on their assessments and learning progress, Pathway generates personalized analytics and insights that help students understand their strengths, identify areas for improvement, and track their development over time.

For initiative managers and administrators, Pathway provides a unified dashboard to monitor participation, student engagement, assessment results, and overall initiative performance. By centralizing data and providing real-time analytics, the platform helps organizations make better decisions while improving the learning experience for every student.

Built for **Ministry of Communications** by team **GHR4 — SWD5 — S2 — Project 1**.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

* **Centralize Training Initiatives** — Bring all training initiatives into one unified platform, making them easier to manage and access.
* **Simplify Student Enrollment** — Allow students to browse available initiatives and enroll through a single, user-friendly system.
* **Self-Assessment System** — Enable students to evaluate their own skills and receive personalized feedback based on their results.
* **Student Analytics Dashboard** — Provide visual reports and analytics that help students monitor their progress and identify strengths and improvement areas.
* **Initiative Performance Dashboard** — Give administrators real-time insights into participation, engagement, assessment results, and overall initiative performance.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making** — Transform assessment and participation data into meaningful insights that support continuous improvement for both students and initiative organizers.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Layer            | Technology                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend          | ASP.NET Core MVC (C#)                                                                                            |
| Data access      | Entity Framework Core — Code-First, with migrations                                                              |
| Frontend         | Razor views, Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery Validation (unobtrusive)                                                  |
| Custom scripting | Vanilla JS (`wwwroot/js/pathway.js`) for theming & opportunity filtering                                         |
| Database         | Relational database via EF Core _(confirm exact provider — SQL Server / SQLite / other — in `appsettings.json`)_ |

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

> These are the standard steps for an ASP.NET Core MVC + EF Core (Code-First) project. Please confirm the exact connection string / database provider in `appsettings.json` and adjust if needed.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ItcProjects-R4/GHR4_SWD5_S2_PROJECT1.git
   cd GHR4_SWD5_S2_PROJECT1
   ```
2. **Open the solution** in Visual Studio (or open the folder in VS Code with the C# extension).
3. **Restore dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```
4. **Configure the database connection** — set your connection string in `appsettings.json` (or `appsettings.Development.json`).
5. **Apply migrations to create the database**
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
6. **Run the project**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   or press **F5** in Visual Studio. The app will open at `https://localhost:<port>` (port shown in the console output).
7. **Seeded sample data** — `DataSeeder.cs` pre-populates sample Users, Student Profiles, Initiatives, and Opportunities so you can explore the app immediately. Check `Models/DataSeeder.cs` for the exact seeded accounts.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Expand the matching engine with more granular skill-tag based recommendations.
- Add notifications (email/in-app) for grade updates, request approvals, and new matching opportunities.
- Implement optimistic concurrency (`RowVersion`) on grade/attendance updates to safely support multiple instructors editing the same record.
- Add richer analytics and reporting for Admins (cohort comparisons, track completion trends).
